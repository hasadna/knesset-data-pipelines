Recommended way to get started is to create and activate a project virtual environment.

You should ensure you are using a supported Python version, you can check the .travis.yml to see which versions we use for CI.

* [Pythonz](https://github.com/saghul/pythonz#installation) can be used to install a specific Python version.
* [Virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation) can help setting up and managing virtualenvs

## Quickstart

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.6.1
$ make install
$ make test
```
